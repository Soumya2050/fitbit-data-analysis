# Problem Statement
To build a regression model to predict the calories burnt based on the given indicators in the training data. 

# Prediction Data Description
 
Client will send the data in multiple set of files in batches at a given location. Data will contain climate indicators in 10 columns.
Apart from prediction files, we also require a "schema" file from client which contains all the relevant information about the training files such as:
Name of the files, Length of Date value in FileName, Length of Time value in FileName, Number of Columns, Name of the Columns and their datatype.

# Data Validation  
In this step, we perform different sets of validation on the given set of training files.  
1) Name Validation- We validate the name of the files on the basis of given Name in the schema file. We have created a regex pattern as per the name given in schema file, to use for validation. After validating the pattern in the name, we check for length of date in the file name as well as length of time in the file name. If all the values are as per requirement, we move such files to "Good_Data_Folder" else we move such files to "Bad_Data_Folder". 
2) Number of Columns - We validate the number of columns present in the files, if it doesn't match with the value given in the schema file then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder". 
3) Name of Columns - The name of the columns is validated and should be same as given in the schema file. If not, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder". 
4) Datatype of columns - The datatype of columns is given in the schema file. This is validated when we insert the files into Database. If dataype is wrong then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder". 
5) Null values in columns - If any of the columns in a file has all the values as NULL or missing, we discard such file and move it to "Bad_Data_Folder".  

# Data Insertion in Database 
1) Database Creation and connection - Create database with the given name passed. If the database is already created, open the connection to the database. 
2) Table creation in the database - Table with name - "Good_Data", is created in the database for inserting the files in the "Good_Data_Folder" on the basis of given column names and datatype in the schema file. If table is already present then new table is not created, and new files are inserted the already present table as we want training to be done on new as well old training files.     
3) Insertion of files in the table - All the files in the "Good_Data_Folder" are inserted in the above-created table. If any file has invalid data type in any of the columns, the file is not loaded in the table and is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".


# Prediction 
 
1) Data Export from Db - The data in the stored database is exported as a CSV file to be used for prediction.
2) Data Preprocessing   
   a) Drop columns not useful for training the model. Such columns were selected while doing the EDA.
   b) Replace the invalid values with numpy “nan” so we can use imputer on such values.
   c) Check for null values in the columns. If present, impute the null values.
   d) Scale the training data.
3) Clustering - KMeans model created during training is loaded, and clusters for the preprocessed prediction data is predicted.
4) Prediction - Based on the cluster number, the respective model is loaded and is used to predict the data for that cluster.
5) Once the prediction is made for all the clusters, the predictions along with the original names before label encoder are saved in a CSV file at a given location and the location is returned to the client.
 
# Deployment

We will be deploying the model to the Pivotal Web Services Platform. 
This is a workflow diagram for the prediction of using the trained model.
